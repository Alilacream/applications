Welcome to my application Repository, here where i encourage myself into making projects that either benefits people i know, or projects that really interests me. this project is based from a big data excel management file for enginners.
-----> this big data file contains a lot of columns but the most important ones are (NÂ° PRIX, DESIGNATION,UNITE,QUANTITES,P.U DH.HT, Total, Description). as you see the description makes a lot of space in the table making the table kinda of unreadable
hence this project came to resolve this solution, by importing the big data table, it devides this table into two elements, excel file table containing each column but removing the description, and a word file that contains the N PRIX DESGINATION
and the description below, making the table excel much more readable since it contains only the key words of calculation , and the word file doing it's job to contain all of the verbose description.
Note: the coded this app in the sole purpose of helping my brother, i have vibe coded it but i don't take joy in "VIBE coding" this app, but i took my time and analysed a lot of chunk of code (exporting functions, importing functions, error handling functions, and finally html tag threading)
this is the version 1 of the app, but i'm willing to devide the big chunk code into multiplbe compenents. wish me luck in my journy and i wish the same for every dev that have read this repo
